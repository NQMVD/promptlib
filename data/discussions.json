    "prompt_id": "2c784504-489d-4241-a1f6-47be12164e32",
    "questions": [
      "What specific dark mode design system or components should be used (e.g., Tailwind CSS with Anthropic-like colors, or a specific library like Chakra UI)?",
      "How should the backend/API integration be handled for OpenRouter (e.g., via a serverless function, proxy, or direct client-side calls with API key management)?",
      "Can you specify the exact data structure needed for linking prompts, versions, and variants (e.g., should it be a tree structure, linear history, or tagged versions)?",
      "What authentication or user management is required (e.g., local storage only, or user accounts with database persistence)?",
      "Are there any specific input/output format requirements for the prompt editor (e.g., Markdown support, syntax highlighting, variables injection)?",
      "How should the configurable model for enhancement/evolution be selected (e.g., a dropdown of OpenRouter models, or a fixed setting)?",
      "What should happen to the user's notes after the evolution process completes (e.g., archived, deleted, or kept for the next iteration)?",
      "In the discussion mode, should the generated questions and ideas be interactive (e.g., clickable to insert into the prompt) or just read-only text?",
      "For viewing previous versions, do you prefer a timeline view, a side-by-side diff view, or a list with previews?",
      "Is there a requirement for exporting or sharing these prompts and their history outside the application?"
    ],
    "additions": [
      "Include a 'Version Control' sidebar that visualizes the prompt history as a tree/graph, allowing easy navigation between base, enhanced, evolved, and discussed versions.",
      "Add a 'Prompt Variables' input section to define placeholders (e.g., {{user_input}}) that can be previewed/tested before sending to the model.",
      "Implement a 'Diff Viewer' component specifically for the comparison view to highlight changes between the base prompt and its variants (enhanced/evolved).",
      "Add a 'System Prompt' input field separate from the main prompt, as AI agents often require distinct system instructions.",
      "Include a 'Settings' modal to configure the OpenRouter API key, default model selection, and temperature/top-p parameters for generation.",
      "Implement local persistence (IndexedDB or LocalStorage) to save prompts and history automatically, ensuring no data loss on refresh.",
      "Add a 'Copy to Clipboard' success toast notification for all generated prompts.",
      "Create a 'Feedback Loop' UI in the Evolve tab where users can rate the evolved prompt (thumbs up/down) to potentially train a custom fine-tuning dataset.",
      "Add a 'Prompt Library' view where users can browse, search, and filter all saved prompts and their descriptions."
